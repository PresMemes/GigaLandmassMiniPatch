## test.sav
Put `test.sav` into your `Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\save games` folder, and it should boot you straight to the Giga settings screen, and I've already reseached all techs and maxed your resources. Of course, you can always make your own save and use that for testing.

You do NOT need a new game for .asset file changes, loading an existing one is perfectly fine.

## Known issues
NOTE: Sometimes, changing a planet's class via console (planet_class pc_flat_world) will make it dissapear. In that case, you need to make it spawn naturally. 
```
- (PLANET CLASS) Planetary Computer does not scale for some reason.  
```
## To do
- Planet and Star Scaling  
  - Blokkat stuff needs to be tested
  - Flusio-Arcology needs to be tested naturally (can't use planet_class console commands)
- Ship Scaling  
- Megastructure Scaling
