# GigaLandmassMiniPatch
Most of the stuff below is just for debugging purposes

## Load order
```
UI Overhaul Dynamic
Landmass
Miniatures
Gigastructural Engineering & More (3.4)
Gigastructures - Landmass - Miniatures patch
```
Or something like that  

Put `GigaLandmassMiniPatch` into your `Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mods` folder and Irony should detect it. (Or your custom mod folder if you have one set up)

Make sure to download Gigastructures https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237 so you can check the original files

You do NOT need a new game for .asset file changes, loading an existing one is perfectly fine.

## Known issues
NOTE: Sometimes, changing a planet's class via console (planet_class pc_flat_world) will make it dissapear. In that case, you need to spawn it naturally. Either through the intended event chain (EHOF stuff) or unzipping your save game to find which star a certain planet spawned.

- (AETERNUM/MEGASTRUCTURE) Orbital Arcology does not scale with the Planetary Computers? Works fine with other planets.
